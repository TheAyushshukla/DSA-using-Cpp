# 💻 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) 🚀

Hey there! I'm Ayush — a CSE student on a mission to master Data Structures & Algorithms .

This repo is a collection of all the DSA topics I’ve covered while learning and practicing with C++ . Whether it’s arrays or graphs, it's all in here.

## 🧠 What I’ve Covered

- ✅ **Arrays** – basics, sliding window, two pointers, prefix sums
- ✅ **Strings** – manipulation, hashing, pattern matching
- ✅ **Linked List** – singly, doubly, circular, reverse, middle, detect loop
- ✅ **Stacks & Queues** – using arrays, linked lists, deque
- ✅ **Recursion & Backtracking** – base case, permutations, N-Queens
- ✅ **Trees & BST** – traversals, height, diameter, balanced BST, LCA
- ✅ **Heaps & Priority Queues** – max heap, min heap, heapsort
- ✅ **HashMaps & HashSets** – frequency, collisions, custom hashing
- ✅ **Graphs** – BFS, DFS, shortest path (Dijkstra, Floyd), Union-Find
- ✅ **Greedy & DP** – coin change, LIS, 0/1 Knapsack, memoization, tabulation
- ✅ **Searching & Sorting** – binary search, quicksort, mergesort
- ✅ **Sliding Window & Two Pointer** – optimized approaches
